            <p>When you bring your new dog or puppy home, you're likely to feel a wide range of emotions.
                 On the one hand, you're ecstatic about your gorgeous new pet, but you're probably also 
                 concerned about how they'll fit into your family and whether you're ready to care for 
                 them. When I brought home my dog, Addy, I experienced all of these feelings—and more!
                I'm inclined to assume you're better prepared than you think (especially if you're reading this),
                 but just in case, here's my list of must-have dog goods, based on my own personal experience. 
                 You'll be totally prepared for anything dog ownership throws at you with these tools on hand, 
                 allowing you to relax and enjoy every moment.</p><hr/>
            <p>Some doggy products we have in our disposal include;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dog collar in different sizes</li>
                    <p>First and foremost, your dog will require a collar. If you adopt from a shelter or a breeder,
                         they may provide you with a collar, but chances are you'll want one that matches your style. 
                         When searching for a dog collar, choose one that is the correct size for your dog, has a quick-release 
                         clasp for safety, and a durable D-ring for attaching a leash. Dog tags can also be attached to extra loops 
                         on collars like this one from Blueberry Pet so they don't get in the way of your leash.</p>
                            <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0caef49784e8e807c1b10905491c020013162339/c=0-0-791-445/local/-/media/2020/05/28/USATODAY/usatsports/Reviewed.com-RvEW-24856-1-collar.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp">
             
               <li>Crates for mandatory naptime</li>
                        <p>It is entirely up to you whether or not you crate train your dog, but many pet owners and expert trainers 
                            encourage it. I crated Addy until she was around 6 months old, simply to make sure she didn't wreck anything 
                            or have accidents throughout
                             the night while I was gone.
                            If you do decide to crate train, the Frisco Wire Dog Crate is a good choice because it has a dividing panel 
                            for growing dogs and folds up for convenient transport. Because accidents happen, it also includes two doors 
                            and an easy-to-clean plastic base.</p>

                <li>Dogs Comfy beds </li>
                            <p>Many pet owners desire soft, comfy beds for their dogs, but if you're not sure if your new dog is a chewer,
                                 you might want to go with one of these elevated dog beds instead. The elevated design of these beds, which  include a steel 
                                frame wrapped in durable, PVC-coated fabric, will keep your dog cooler on hot days. Dogs seem to enjoy this
                                 bed, and several reviewers point out that you can cover it with a blanket or towel if you want to offer your dog more comfort.</p>
                                <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0caef49784e8e807c1b10905491c020013162339/c=0-0-791-445/local/-/media/2020/05/28/USATODAY/usatsports/Reviewed.com-RvEW-24856-3-bed.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp">
               
                 <li>Airtight storage containers</li>
                                <p>Mice, cockroaches, and other undesirable pests may break into your dog food supply if you don't store it in an airtight container.
                                     These stackable pet food containers, which can carry up to 40 or 60 pounds of kibble and have handy 
                                    spin-off lids, are a popular choice for dog food. Their airtight seal keeps pests out and odors in, and they're made of heavy-duty,
                                     BPA-free food-grade plastic.</p>
                                <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0caef49784e8e807c1b10905491c020013162339/c=0-0-791-445/local/-/media/2020/05/28/USATODAY/usatsports/Reviewed.com-RvEW-24856-5-food-container.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp">
            
                    <li>Sturdy leashes</li>
                                    <p>Another necessary item for dog owners is a leash, but not all leashes are created equal. Personally, I prefer leashes with double
                                         handles, which have a loop at the end of the leash as well as a loop halfway down for when you want to keep your dog near to you.
                                          This particular double-handle leash is 6-feet long and composed of heavy-duty nylon, with luminous stitching for nighttime walking.</p>
                                        <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/925c90cac2950828bbb61819371c14292ee6081b/c=0-0-792-446/local/-/media/2020/05/28/USATODAY/usatsports/Reviewed.com-RvEW-24856-7-leash.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp">

                <li>Washable dog bowls</li>
                                        <p>These cheap stainless steel bowls are a terrific option for your new dog's food and water bowls. They have a rubber base to avoid 
                                            skidding and protect your floors, and they have a 4-34% cup capacity, so they're perfect for medium to large dogs. Plus, if the 
                                            bowls get dirty, you can easily clean them by tossing them in the dishwasher.</p>
                                        <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/925c90cac2950828bbb61819371c14292ee6081b/c=0-0-792-446/local/-/media/2020/05/28/USATODAY/usatsports/Reviewed.com-RvEW-24856-8-bowls.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp">
                <li>Foods mats</li>
                                        <p>It's also a good idea to invest in a food mat, which will protect your floor from your dog's food dish. When my dog started playing 
                                            in her water dish, I bought one of these to contain the mess and keep my hardwood floors from becoming wet. The silicone mat includes
                                             a raised lip to collect spillage and is stain-resistant, making cleanup a breeze.</p>
                                            <img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0caef49784e8e807c1b10905491c020013162339/c=0-0-791-445/local/-/media/2020/05/28/USATODAY/usatsports/Reviewed.com-RvEW-24856-9-food-mat.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp">

                <li>Konk toys</li>
                                            <p>Addy used to have a Kong stuffed with peanut butter and fruit every night before bedtime because that was the only way she would
                                                 go to sleep without making a fuss in her crate. Even though she's grown up, I still use our Kong toy
                                                 to keep her occupied when I'm at work or if we'll be gone all day. We actually have four of them!
                                                As you can see, I'm a major admirer of the Kong, which is simply a hollow rubber toy. You can fill it with any kind of treat or food,
                                                 and your dog will be entertained for hours as he tries to get the goodies out. You can even put them in the freezer to preserve them fresh.</p>

                <li>Doggie water bottles</li>
                                                <p>If you've ever gone hiking with your dog, you know how vital it is to have enough water for both of you, and if you don't want to share your
                                                     water bottle, this product will be perfect for you. Because you can squeeze water into the bowl for your dog to drink, this portable
                                                     water bottle and bowl in one is really useful. When your dog has finished drinking, simply open the bottle and let the residual water to drip
                                                      back down into the interior—no water is lost!</p>

                <li>Dog brushes</li>
                                                    <p>A good dog brush will save you a lot of time and effort vacuuming pet hair off your carpets and furniture, and many pet parents swear by the FURminator. 
                                                        The brush comes in two different designs for long- and short-hair dogs, and it’s incredibly effective at removing loose undercoat hair without cutting skin or
                                                         damaging the topcoat. The FURminator is more expensive than other brushes, but reviewers swear it’s worth it if your dog sheds a lot.</p>

                <li>Shampoos and conditioners</li>
                                                <p>After a long day of swimming or playing in the dirt, your dog will probably be quite stinky! When this happens, it’s time to break out the licking mat listed above 
                                                    and give them a good bath. The Buddy Wash Original Lavender & Mint Dog Shampoo and Conditioner is a top-rated product among pet parents, who say it will leave your 
                                                    dog super soft and smelling fresh. Plus, it’s gentle enough for pups with sensitive skin.</p>
